# matrixbackup #

This is a tool that implements downloading of data from all rooms user has access to, to a set of json files. The json files are stored in hierarchy room-human-readable-alias:room-id/yyyy-mm-dd/data.json, where data.json contains all data for that particular day for that room.

The default credentials file is `~/.config/matrix-commander/credentials.json`. Command-line flags always override values found in the config file.

## Usage example ( git ) ##

After checkout:

```
go run . --server <YOUR_HOMESERVER_URL> --user <YOUR_USER_ID> --token <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> --dir ./my_matrix_backup
```

or, if you are Matrix Commander user, you have your credentials in ~/.config/matrix-commander/credentials.json, and you want backups in backup/ directory:

```
go run .
```

## Installation ( non git ) ##

This can be also installed using

```
go install github.com/fingon/go-matrixbackup@latest
```

and then you can use the command, assuming you have Go binary directory in your PATH:

```
go-matrixbackup ...
```

if you wish to use it without git.
